# MVC - Model View Controller
## An introduction to MVC

In programming, model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural design pattern that organizes an application's logic into distinct layers, each of which carries out a specific set of tasks. The layers also interact with each other to ensure that the application's functionality is delivered in a coordinated and consistent manner. The MVC methodology incorporates the entire application, from the user interface (UI) to the underlying data model.

- Model 
  The model is in charge of the Database.
- View 
  The view handles what the client sees or the front end.
- Controller 
  The controller handles the server.

# Separation in MVC
- Model (Server-Side): Responsible for handling data-related concerns. It interacts with the database, processes business logic, and communicates with the controller.
- View (Client-Side): Deals with presentation and user interface concerns. It receives data from the model and presents it to the user. In web development, views are often implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It processes user input, updates the model, and ensures that the view reflects the changes.

# Server-side and Client-side separation
- Server-Side (Back-End): Typically, server-side code deals with the model and part of the controller. It manages data, performs business logic, and communicates with databases and external services.
- Client-Side (Front-End): Front-end code involves the view and part of the controller. It handles user interaction, updates the display, and communicates with the server to fetch or send data.

# Practical Implications
## Code Organization:

- Server-Side: Organize code into modules or classes representing different aspects of the business logic and data processing.
- Client-Side: Separate code into components responsible for UI elements, interactions, and data presentation.
## Communication:

- Server-Side: Focus on APIs and data transfer between the server and the client.
- Client-Side: Handle user interactions and update the UI based on data received from the server.
## Maintainability:

- Server-Side: Easier to update data handling and business logic without affecting the user interface.
- Client-Side: Changes to the UI don't necessarily impact how data is processed on the server.

# What MVC looks like

# Summary
- In summary, the separation of concerns, particularly in the context of MVC, helps create maintainable, modular, and scalable software by organizing code based on its purpose and functionality, both on the server-side and the client-side.
